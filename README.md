# DS-A-projects
The dataset used for this project consists of a variety of customer-related information, including demographic data, subscription details, call records, customer service interactions, and historical churn status. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

The project employs various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, to predict customer churn. Each algorithm is carefully implemented and optimized to achieve the highest predictive accuracy possible.
